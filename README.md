# Strava-Bootstrapping

Quick blog working with Strava API and discussing bootstrapping



The purpose of this project is three-fold:



1. Give me a chance to work with Strava API.
2. Practice explaining a fundamental statistical concept.
3. Work with Dash for the first time to help with (2).



DataCollection.ipynb is focused on the collection of the data (done correctly with tokens correctly sealed away). 

stravaTokenManager.py contains a helper function that enables the DataCollection.ipynb to work. The function in this .py file refreshes all tokens in the .env file.

UnderstandingBootstrappingWithStravaRunData.ipynb is focused on purposes (2) and (3).



The dashboard app code is under app.py. It is being externally hosted under Render.
